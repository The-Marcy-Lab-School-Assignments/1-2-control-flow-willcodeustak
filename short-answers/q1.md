Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer

rounder() and measureRain() were suitable for switch cases because they were comparing a single variable against multiple conditions. In rounder(), the roundSetting parameter was being compared against different string values ('up', 'down', and default).

happyBirthdayPet() and funTypes() cannot be easily expressed using simple value comparisons.
